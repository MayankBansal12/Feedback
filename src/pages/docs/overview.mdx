# quick overview

quick overview of how to use feedback and prerequisites

#### simple steps for getting started:

**1. get started by creating a project and a form to start collecting feedbacks** <br/>
head over to [dashboard/project](/dashboard/projects) to create a new project. create a new form inside a project

**2. after creating a new form, get `form id` to track and store feedbacks** <br/>
on feedback form, the form id will look like this: <br/>
`form id: heb33-364hf-23563f`

**3. get client id and client secrets for using apis** <br/>
you can find your client id and client secret from [settings/secrets](/dashboard/settings?tab=secrets). these secrets can be used for feedback external apis. don't push your secrets in public repositories.

**4. use feedback docs and store your user's feedback with ease** <br/>
you will need client id and client secret for authentication, along with form id for collecting feedback inside one form and later managing all inside [dashboard](/dashboard) <br/>
go over to [api reference](/docs/apis) for more info on how to use feedback apis for collecting all feedback inside a form.

<br />
**note: currently feedback only supports external apis. ui and packages are up
next. reach out to us for more feature request.**
